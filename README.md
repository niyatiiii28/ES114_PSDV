Use Matplotlib or Seaborn libraries along with the Numpy to achieve these tasks during the lab sessions on 30 Jan and 2 Feb 2024.

1. Plot the Probability Mass Functions of the following Discrete Random Variables by varying the appropriate parameters taken as input. Compare the plots of the same PMF plotted with different parameters. [2 Marks]

a) Discrete Uniform

b) Bernoulli

c) Binomial

d) Poisson

e) Geometric

2. Show the equivalence of Binomial and Poisson for large values of M and small values of p. [1 Mark]

Use Matplotlib or Seaborn libraries along with the Numpy to achieve these tasks during the lab sessions on 13 and 16 Feb 2024.

1. Plot the Probability Density Functions (PDF) of the following Continuous Random Variables by varying the appropriate parameters taken as user input. Compare the plots of the same PDF plotted with different parameters. [1 Mark]

a) Uniform

b) Gaussian/Normal

c) Exponential

d) Cauchy

e) Laplacian

f) Rayleigh

2. Plot the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of each continuous random variable above by varying parameters values taken as user input if the closed form mathematical expression exists. [1 Mark]

3. Plot the CDF of each discrete random variable given in Lab Assignment 3 by varying parameters values taken as user input (No need to derive closed form expression in this case). [1 Mark]
